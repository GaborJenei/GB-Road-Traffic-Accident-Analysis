# A crash look at England's Road Traffic Accident Data

# Motivation

Road traffic accidents are taking a serious toll on our lives and our communities.
In this project I'm trying uncover some factors and patterns contributing to accidents and the severity of an injury.
Specifically, I try to answer the following questions:
 - How has the number of accidents and severity of accidents change over the last 5 years?
 - What is the distribution of the age groups and gender of the driver of vehicles involved in accidents?
 - Are certain vehicle types or road classes more dangerous?
 - Are injuries tend to be more serious in certain environmental conditions?
 - Where are the accident hot-spots?

# Data
This project is using [Road Safety Data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data) published by the [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport) (DfT)

The data is not duplicated in this repo, it can be accessed here: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data

The data is provided in three tables with a relationship to each other. The data used covers a 5 year period starting 2015 and provides data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). The encoding of the categorical columns is provided in the [data guide](http://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/variable%20lookup.xls) spreadsheet.

The data went through some processing prior to the analysis undertaken to answer the above questions:
 - Categorical columns were converted to Pandas category type
 - certain columns were joined accross different tables
 - rows with missing values were dropped
